Contact Book Application

Statement of Problem:

The application provides an efficient way of managing contacts to the users. Every

user has a large number of contacts that the user has to be able to store and access as and

when desired, modify and manage. This system will provide functionality to enable the user

to store, access and manage his contacts, all through an easy to use interface.

The user can open this application whenever he needs to look up any number. He will

be able to a list of all the contacts that he has entered and saved in the application storage.

Then he can select anyone out of his several contacts to view the desired number or search

for the desired contact.

The application user should be able to enter a new contact whenever he desires. For

this, he opens the application. Here, he can see an option to add a contact. On clicking on it,

the interface to add a contact opens, here the user has to fill in the details, the phone number

and the name with which he has to store a contact, the email id of the person and so on. The

user can choose to save the contact or cancel it which takes the user back to the previous

interface.

There is search facility provided for the user to save the time and effort of scrolling

down to the desired contact. The user can type in the name of the contact he wants to search

for in the search box provided at the top. The search algorithm returns all the contacts that

have the string entered in the search box in the name field.

The user can delete a contact that removes the contact with all its details. Deleting

removes the contact entirely and cannot be restored. The user can also edit the information of

a particular contact. He can search for a particular contact by entering his name in the search

box then select a contact from among the search results and can edit the name, phone number

as well as additional information.

In addition to this, there is a feature by which the user can place together all the

related contacts into a group so as to enable him a convenient access to the contacts. There

are groups, family and work, in which user can add contacts as also delete them as and when

required. He can go to groups and select a particular group to view the members of that

group or look up a contact through groups which will be more convenient that searching

among all the contacts.

A number of additional features can be added to the system for enhancing the system

after the first implementation is successful. There can be an import and export facility for

contacts. A user can import already stored contacts from a file stored on his system. He can

also export contacts to a file if he desires. The number of groups can be increased. There can

be a facility to dial a number on the keypad of the phone and through this add the number as a

new or an existing contact. There can be a facility to store the favourite contacts. The

favourites can be added as a tab on the top. On clicking the user can see a list of contacts that

are in his favourites. He can add contacts to favourites and delete contacts from favourites.

Favourites are basically to enable quick access to the contacts that the user most frequently

contacts.
